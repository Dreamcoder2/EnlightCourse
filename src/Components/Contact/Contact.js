              automation framework is a set of guidelines, coding standards, and
              tools that help in efficient and effective test automation.

              The WebDriver is a key component of Selenium that allows you to
              interact with web browsers. You need to set up the WebDriver for
              the browser you intend to automate (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome,
              GeckoDriver for Firefox).

              Create test scripts using the chosen programming language. Test
              scripts are sequences of commands that interact with web elements
              on a webpage. You can locate elements using various locators such
              as ID, name, class name, XPath, etc.

              DevOps emphasizes a cultural shift, fostering collaboration and
              communication between traditionally siloed development and
              operations teams. The goal is to break down barriers and create a
              shared responsibility for the entire software delivery lifecycle.
              DevOps promotes a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging
              teams to regularly reflect on their processes and identify areas
              for optimization. This involves learning from failures,
              implementing feedback loops, and embracing a mindset of constant
              enhancement. A key tenet of DevOps is the automation of manual and
              repetitive tasks throughout the software development lifecycle.
              This includes automating testing, deployment, infrastructure
              provisioning, and more.Developers regularly integrate their code
              changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests
              are triggered. This helps identify and address integration issues
              early in the development process.With continuous delivery, the
              software is kept in a deployable state at all times
